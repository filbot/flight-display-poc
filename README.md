Flight Panel Display

This project is a web-based simulation of an aircraft information panel. It recreates the look and feel of an illuminated avionics-style display using only HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript.

The interface includes:
	•	Power indicator lamp that glows when the panel is active
	•	Aircraft type selectors (Civil, Commercial, Military) with realistic backlighting
	•	OLED-style data display showing origin and destination airports, distance, souls on board, and altitude

Sample data is included to demonstrate functionality, with realistic airport codes, distances, passenger counts, and altitudes. This makes it ideal for prototyping, UI design reference, or as a base for integrating with real-time aviation data APIs.
